## ZMX in ZIO 1.x becomes ZIO Metrics Connectors

With the release of **ZIO Metrics Connectors** the original repository for ZMX will be archived 
and available read only for future reference. 

The API to capture metrics has moved into ZIO core for ZIO 2.x and later. Therefore ZIO Metrics Connectors 
concentrates on providing the backend connectivity to report the captured metrics. The design 
goal is to have the same instrumentation of the application for any selected backend.
